# SpaceInputs
An input library that fits all of your input needings. Currently, SpaceInputs can run over XLib. But we'll add support for terminal and as well as Windows.

### How to build?
Well, the building process is pretty easy since there aren't any dependancies except a C++17 supported compiler. You just type this in your terminal:

```
make library
./install.sh
make examples
```
And you are done!
